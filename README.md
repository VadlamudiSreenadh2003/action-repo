# action-repo

## 📌 Purpose of the Repo
This repository contains a custom GitHub Actions workflow designed for automating tasks like building, testing, or deploying code when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

## ⚙️ What the Action Does
- Sets up the required environment (e.g., Node.js)
- Installs dependencies
- Runs test scripts or build processes
- Can be extended to deploy or notify after success

## 🧪 How to Test It
1. Push any code change to the `main` branch.
2. GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the workflow defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.
3. You can monitor the action run under the **Actions** tab.

> 💡 Make sure the workflow file is present at:  
> `.github/workflows/main.yml`
